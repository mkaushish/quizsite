VIEW STRUCTURE FOR PROBLEMS:
  The goal of this swection is to explain how we convert a QuestionBase into HTML.

What we start with:
  QuestionBase
    | +- .text (array of HTMLObj's)
    +--- .soln (hash of solnname) -> solnval

The Process:
  Basically we want to display every HTMLObj in text.  To do this, we have a series of nested partials
    problem/_problem.html.erb = iterates through text, choosing the appropriate subpartials
    | +--> _multihtmlobj.html.erb = Displays MultiHTMLObjs  ]\ 
    +----> _htmlobj.html.erb  = displays single htmlobjs    ]/> these are either in problem, or problemanswer, depending on
              | |                                               whether you just want the problem, or also the answer
              | |
              | +-> problem/_inputfield.html.erb = displays individual input fields in either mutli or singular htmlobj's
              +---> problemanswer/_responsefield.html.erb = TODO what again?

NOTES:
-------------------

PRECOMPILING ASSETS
  * add to precompiled assets in config/environments/production
  * RAILS_ENV=prodcution be rake assets:precompile
  * assets are compiled to /public/assets, so make sure you git add and commit that
  * ensure that shit changes when pushed to heruok (try pushing both production and master branches?)

a useful setting!
Look for the file /usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/config.rb and edit it.

Replace the line

:DoNotReverseLookup => nil,
with

:DoNotReverseLookup => true,
Restart webrick and it'll work like a charm :)

Note, much of the code in this was taken from Micheal Hartls excellent Ruby on Rails Tutorial

Instructions for setting up posgresql on ubuntu:
------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql
$ sudo su postgres # ubuntu package creates user postgres by default
$ createuser -d <username> # where user name is your user name
$ # answer yes at superuser prompt
$ bundle install # Gemfile should include a line saying "gem 'pg'"
$ rake db:create:all
