Short Term
----------
[ ] add some css for fractions
[ ] view thinks all fractions are inputfields - only if they are text fields don't make them correct
[ ] make explanations only keep showing once you get the right answer on the previous one
[ ] display problems in reverse chronological order in profile
[ ] radio button text field
[ ] fix TODO's throughout code
[ ] fix suitable arrangement stuff in chapter 2
[ ] commas seem to not be preprocessed out, see writinginternational
[ ] 7186110.to_international returns something and 17???
[ ] keep text fields from autocompleting
[ ] in preprocessing we should also
[ ] disallow going back and redoing problems

Long Term
---------
[ ] select problems from prestocked group
[ ] make the quiz store better (not marshal dump/load every request)
[ ] add quiz model - track stats over each quiz, view past quizzes, etc
[ ] research ajax for calculator/multiform input fields
[ ] track user statistics, and do stuff with them
[ ] Allow partial credit on problems
