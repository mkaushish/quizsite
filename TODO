1) store the quiz (which problems are allowed) info in session data
2) allow display of other input fields besides radio/text fields
3) add users
4) fix TODO's throughout code
5) add support for multitextfields - dynamic number of text fields
		or perhaps just generic, and specify which ones you can add?
6) research ajax calaculator
7) radio button text field

8) error if you haven't selected problems currently
9) make the quiz store better (not marshal dump/load every request)
10) fraction input not working => test with problem ToImproperFraction
11) In multipart questions, if one answer is correct, it should only display it once (outlined in green)
12) debug EquivalenFractions thing
13) write out number in words not working
14) successor and predecessor not working

eventually:
	* select problems from prestocked group
