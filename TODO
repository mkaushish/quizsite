1) store the quiz (which problems are allowed) info in session data
2) allow display of other input fields besides radio/text fields
3) add users
4) fix TODO's throughout code
5) add support for multitextfields - dynamic number of text fields
		or perhaps just generic, and specify which ones you can add?
