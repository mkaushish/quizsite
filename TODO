Short Term
----------
[ ] debug EquivalenFractions thing
[ ] write out number in words not working
[ ] successor and predecessor not working
[ ] fraction input not working => test with problem ToImproperFraction
[ ] radio button text field
[ ] add users
[ ] fix TODO's throughout code
[ ] add support for multitextfields - dynamic number of text fields
		or perhaps just generic, and specify which ones you can add?

Long Term
---------
[ ] select problems from prestocked group
[ ] make the quiz store better (not marshal dump/load every request)
[ ] research ajax for calculator/multiform input fields

Completed
---------
[X] allow display of other input fields besides radio/text fields
[X] error if you haven't selected problems currently
[X] In multipart questions, if one answer is correct, it should only display it once (outlined in green)
[X] store the quiz (which problems are allowed) info in session data
