				<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="blue_text text_italic">It works like a game - </strong>You get rewards for achieving certain objectives, such as completing a problem set. This is in the form of points or even badges!! There are progress bars all over the website which you need to transform from red to blue</p>
				
				<p class="text_justify"><strong class="green_text text_italic">You can figure out where exactly you need help - </strong>You can go through our graphs to figure out where you need help, where you have improved and where you are comfortable</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="blue_text text_italic">You can discuss problems with your teacher - </strong>When you have completed a problem, you can leave a note for your teacher in the comment box. Your teacher can reply to you and you can reply back</p>

				<p class="text_justify"><strong class="green_text text_italic">You can answer interesting problems posed by your teacher, your classmates or you can post problems yourself - </strong>Have you come across a maths problem recently you found tricky and you think your whole class would be interested in? Post it on your classâ€™ discussion forum</p>

				<p class="text_justify"><strong class="green_text text_italic">Saves you effort and time - </strong>You will no longer have the need to prepare assessments for your students or even grade them, especially in cases where you wish to test basic skills. You can instead spend time and effort on improving your student's higher-order thinking skills. </p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="blue_text text_italic">Gives you detailed feedback - </strong>You can delve deep into the assessment of your class or of individual students, right down to the level of specific problems they have attempted. The feedback is in the form of graphs as well as downloadable Excel files.</p>

				<p class="text_justify"><strong class="green_text text_italic">Allows you to interact with individual students or your class - </strong>The social aspect of SmarterGrades is the integral part of our package for schools. Students can participate in our discussion forum, with topics initiated by them or by you. Posts can include videos, images and text. However, discussions can also occur between you and specific students through problems they have answered.</p>
