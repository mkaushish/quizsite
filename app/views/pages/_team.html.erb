    Madhav majored in Maths at Oberlin College. His teachers in school played a huge role in Madhav loving maths from a young age. They pushed him to experiment with new concepts and go beyond the prescribed textbook. Madhav's aim is to make Smarter Grades available to the largest possible audience. For Madhav, the possibility of translating Smarter Grades into other languages, while ensuring low bandwidth requirements, is the most exciting aspect of the product.

      Thomas studied Computer Science at Oberlin. He loves math puzzles and problems, but this was not always the case.  It took years of college courses for him to disassociate math from tedious problem sets and repetition.  He joined Smarter Grades to make math accessible and enjoyable to high school students by giving each student personalized attention and problem sets that focus on learning, not repetition.
