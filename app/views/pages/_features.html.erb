        Unlike most other testing websites, Smarter Grades doesn't just have multiple choice questions. Maths exams and tests usually do not usually give students options to choose from, and therefore we feel that multiple choice question are neither good at explaining concepts, nor at preparing students for exams.  Instead ask the student to come up with the answer themselves, and where possible we use web technology to come up with novel ways for students to answer questions.  Try playing with our <%= link_to "compass and straight edge", draw_path %> and <%= link_to "graphing calculator", graph_path %> apps, with which students will answer questions and get explanations.

      Our questions also come with step by step explanations available to students when they get the question wrong. These explanations are not just a few lines of text, but prompt students at every step for pieces of vital information.  Try getting our <%= link_to "estimate_arithmetic", "#" %> question wrong to see how we guide students through the method for solving problems

      The first thing we do to prepare a student for a test is have them try a few of problems to get a feel for their strengths and weaknesses.  For example, if a student gets a question right 3 times in a row, we can guess that he/she understands that question fairly well. Using these initial results we give the student a "PScore" for each question, which represents how well we think he/she understands that question.  After that, while the student practices the test, we use our <%= link_to "spaced repetition", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" %> algorithm to give them dynamic problem sets which focus on problems that students don't yet fully understand.

      If you don't know how adding works, you can never learn to multiply.  Other websites will superficially give students the formula for multiplication without making them work out the deeper issues they have. We understand that beneath every maths question there is a breadth of concepts one must understand.  In fact, for each of our questions, we have identified those concepts.  If a student repeatedly has trouble on a problem, instead of giving them the same problem over and over again, we zero in on their deeper weaknesses.

      Our questions are generated by a computer in order to ensure that you never get the same exact question twice.  We have worked closely with teachers to ensure that we only give questions like those a student will see on an exam.
