    SmarterGrades is an online tutor for CBSE maths.  We give students personalized attention and problems sets to prepare them for their exams.  Our PScore predicts how well the students will do on each type of question, and allows us to focus on the problems the student is having trouble with.  
    </p> 
    <p> 
    Our problems sets are about learning, not testing.  That's why when a student gets a problem wrong we don't just mark it wrong - we guide the student through the steps in solving the problem.  This way we can ensure that every student has complete understanding of every question.
    </p>
    <p>
    SmarterGrades is going to enter alpha testing soon.  If you would like to sign your child up for personal online maths instruction, please email us at signup@smartergrades.com!

          The PScore is how well we predict you will do on a question/quiz.  We use it to figure out the best problems for you to practice.

          If students are having trouble with a problem, we teach them how to break down each problem into simple steps.  Then we help them understand each step.

      <h2>Many Question Types</h2>
      <p> Unlike most other testing websites, Smarter Grades doesn't just have multiple choice questions. Maths exams and tests usually do not usually give students options to choose from, and therefore we feel that multiple choice question are neither good at explaining concepts, nor at preparing students for exams.  Instead ask the student to come up with the answer themselves, and where possible we use web technology to come up with novel ways for students to answer questions.  Try playing with our <%= link_to "compass and straight edge", draw_path %> and <%= link_to "number line", numberline_path %> apps, both of which students use to answer questions.  
    </div>

    <div class="feature b_yellow"> 
      <h2>Individual Explainations</h2>
      <p>Our questions also come with step by step explanations available to students when they get the question wrong. These explanations are not just a few lines of text, but prompt students at every step for pieces of vital information.  Try getting our <%= link_to "estimate_arithmetic", "#" %> question wrong to see how we guide students through the method for solving problems</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature b_orange"> 
      <h2>Unlimited Questions</h2>
      <p>Our questions are generated by a computer in order to ensure that you never get the same exact question twice.  We have worked closely with teachers to ensure that we only give questions like those a student will see on an exam.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div class="feature b_blue"> 
      <h2> PScore and Analytics </h2>
      <p> The first thing we do to prepare a student for a test is have them try a few of problems to get a feel for their strengths and weaknesses.  For example, if a student gets a question right 3 times in a row, we can guess that he/she understands that question fairly well. Using these initial results we give the student a "PScore" for each question, which represents how well we think he/she understands that question.  After that, while the student practices the test, we use our <%= link_to "spaced repetition", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" %> algorithm to give them dynamic problem sets which focus on problems that students don't yet fully understand.
    </div>

    <div class="feature b_red"> 
      <h2> Zeros in on Deeper Weaknesses </h2>
      <p> If you don't know how adding works, you can never learn to multiply.  Other websites will superficially give students the formula for multiplication without making them work out the deeper issues they have. We understand that beneath every maths question there is a breadth of concepts one must understand.  In fact, for each of our questions, we have identified those concepts.  If a student repeatedly has trouble on a problem, instead of giving them the same problem over and over again, we zero in on their deeper weaknesses, </p>

            Madhav majored in Maths at Oberlin College. He has loved maths from a young age, and his teachers in school played a huge role in this. They pushed him to experiment with new concepts and go beyond the prescribed textbook. He decided to start Smarter Grades to give others a great high school math experience as well. Madhav's aim is to make Smarter Grades available to the largest possible audience. For Madhav, the possibility of translating Smarter Grades into other languages, while ensuring low bandwidth requirements, is the most exciting aspect of the product.

            Thomas studied Computer Science at Oberlin. He loves math puzzles and problems, but this was not always the case.  It took years of college courses for him to disassociate math from tedious problem sets and repetition.  He joined Smarter Grades to make math accessible and enjoyable to high school students by giving each student personalized attention and problem sets that focus on learning, not repetition.
