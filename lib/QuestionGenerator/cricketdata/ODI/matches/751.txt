*** Play was delayed by 10 minutes due to early rain, and 10 minutes were
    removed from the lunch interval - no reduction in the number of overs.

*** The England innings was shortened when the overs weren't completed by
    6:10pm, the rescheduled close of innings time.

*** Wessels was a runner for the whole of Kirsten's innings

*** Rain interrupted play for 12 minutes with South Africa 231/6 off 42.5
    overs and the over limit was reduced to 43 overs with the target reduced
    by 1 to 252. (The SCG scoreboard and the TV coverage incorrectly
    displayed South Africa needing 22 off 7 balls, then 22 off 1 ball - the
    actual requirement to win was 21 off 1 ball)

*** Chris Lewis bowled the last ball with slow medium pace and Brian McMillan
    took a single with a push to midwicket

*** A Duckworth/Lewis calculation under the rules in 2006 would have first
    set South Africa a target of 273 in 45 overs, and then reduced this to
    257 from 43 overs.
