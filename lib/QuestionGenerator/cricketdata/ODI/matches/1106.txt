*** India innings
*** Tendulkar's aggregate runs in ODIs crosses that of K.Srikkanth (4092).
    Tendulkar now has the second highest aggregate in ODIs for India. Only
    Azharuddin is ahead of him.
*** Kaluwitharana missed a stumping off Tendulkar.
*** Tendulkar's 9th ODI century. Equals Lara and Rameez Raja for the maximum
    number of ODI centuries for an active player. Only C.G.Greenidge (11),
    I.V.A.Richards (11) and D.L.Haynes (17) are ahead overall. G.R.Marsh also
    had 9 centuries.

*** Sri Lanka innings
*** Jayasuriya's 3rd ODI century.
