*** K Srikkanth retired hurt at 7/1

*** Pakistan was 2 runs away from victory in the last ball. Qadir tried an
    impossible 2nd run and was run out thus making India the winner.
    Unfortunately, the umpires had failed to notice a fielding infringement -
    as Kapil ran into bowl the last ball to Manzoor Elahi, only three Indian
    fielders were stationed in the inner ring.
