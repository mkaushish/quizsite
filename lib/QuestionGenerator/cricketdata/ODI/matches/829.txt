*** The rules would have given the game to WI, but the crowd ran onto the
    ground before the fielder threw te ball to Akram at the bowler's end.
    There was no question of Akram throwing the ball to the striker's end for
    a possible run out, since the pitch had by then been overrun. Hence the
    match is ADJUDGED A TIE by the match referee.
