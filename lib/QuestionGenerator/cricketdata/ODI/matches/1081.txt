*** Sri Lanka's 1st ever World Cup semi final.

*** RS Mahanama retired hurt at 182/5 (37.2 overs) (leg injury)

*** At the fall of the 8th Indian wicket, sections of the crowd vented their
    disgust with the state of the match by setting fire to some areas of the
    stands and throwing fruit and waterbottles onto the field. The match was
    briefly stopped and when play was about to resume, the crowd again threw
    bottles at the deep fielders. The match referee stopped the game and the
    game was awarded to Sri Lanka by default.

*** 4th win for the team batting first from 5 matches under lights at Eden
    Gardens.
*** Sri Lanka qualify for their 1st ever World Cup final.
