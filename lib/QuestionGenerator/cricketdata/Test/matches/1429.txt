*** First test played by West Indies in South Africa
*** SM Pollock scored his 1000th Test run, and then took his 100th Test
    wicket.
*** He is the 33rd player to perform this feat in tests, and the second South
    African after TL Goddard. He is the fourth fastest to reach this double
    landmark (after IT Botham, MH Mankad and Kapil Dev). Kapil Dev and JG
    Bracewell of New Zealand are the only players who have reached the 1000
    run/100 wicket milestone in the same test. He emulated his father Peter
    by taking 100 Test wickets - the only other father and son combination
    each to have taken 100 test wickets are Lance and Chris Cairns (NZ).
*** When CA Walsh dismissed Kallis, he became the leading wicket taker for
    West Indies in Tests.
*** His first wicket (Bacher) was his 376th, placing him equal with MD
    Marshall's record.
*** He was later dismissed for his 30th duck in tests, stretching further his
    Test record in this endeavour.
*** RN Lewis was summoned from the West Indies A team in India to replace the
    injured D Ramnarine. He arrived on the morning of the match, and was
    promptly selected for only his 2nd Test.
*** WJ Cronje held his 100th catch in First Class cricket
*** MV Boucher made his 150th First Class dismissal
*** CL Hooper batted with a runner for most of 1st innings and all of 2nd
    innings and did not field in SA first innings.
*** Total of 87 overs lost to rain and bad light, although 1 hour's play
    recovered due to early starts 4th and 5th days.
