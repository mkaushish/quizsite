*** Abel scored the first hundred in first-class cricket in South Africa and
    Tancred became the first batsman to carry his bat through a completed
    Test innings.
*** Briggs set a new Test record by taking 8 for 11 (all bowled) in the
    second innings and 15 for 28 in the match.
*** Ashley took 7 for 95 in his only Test
*** Bowden, aged 23 years 144 days became England's youngest captain three
    years before dying in Umtali Hospital- a glorified mud hut where his body
    had to be protected from marauding lions prior to being interred in a
    coffin made from whiskey cases.
