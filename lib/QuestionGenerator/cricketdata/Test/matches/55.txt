*** J Darling became the first batsman to score two hundreds in the same
    rubber and the first to reach his century with a six which in those days
    involved hitting the ball right out of the ground as opposed to over the
    boundary. This was the first six ever hit in Test cricket without the aid
    of overthrows.
