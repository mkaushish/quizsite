    declined to run 29 comfortable singles.

    (after claiming the final wicket) in only 22 Tests (a record in
    Eng.-Aust. series)
*** RW Marsh becomes the first Australian to appear in 90 Tests. His total
    dismissals in this series reaches 27, which surpasses the record of JHB
    Waite (S.Afr.), set in 1961-62 against New Zealand (5 matches)
*** For the first time in any Test in which all 40 wickets fell, all innings
    totals were within 10 runs of each other.
