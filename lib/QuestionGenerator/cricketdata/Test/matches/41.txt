*** During his match-saving second innings, Turner was struck on the hand and
    dislocated a finger. Dr Grace pulled the joint back into place and he was
    able to continue his last-wicket partnership of 36 with Blackham which
    occupied valuable time for Australia.
*** Gunn's hundred took 250 minutes and was the first in a Test at Old
    Trafford.
*** England made no attempt to score 198 runs in 135 minutes.
