*** Day 1
*** England 1st innings
*** The match was abandoned after ten balls because the bowlers were unable
    to get any solid footholds in an overly sandy outfield. Alan Hurst, the
    ICC match referee, ruled: "The ground conditions, and especially the
    bowlers' run-ups, were unfit and potentially dangerous and we decided it
    would not be possible to rectify those fundamental issues over the course
    of a day or so."
*** The Test was moved to the old Antigua Recreation Ground with play
    scheduled to start on Sunday, February 15, two days later.
*** The statistics from the abandoned Test count towards career records.
