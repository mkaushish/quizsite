*** Australia were unable to to avoid following-on, the compulsory margin in
    1888 being 80 runs.
*** The match ended at 1.52pm (before lunch on the second day), after
    Australia had been bowled out in 69 minutes.
*** Heavy rain before the match produced a soft, wet pitch and gave the side
    batting first an enormous advantage. A hot, drying sun on the second day
    made the pitch a vicious "sticky"; 18 wickets fell before lunch.
