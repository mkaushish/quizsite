*** This Test has special significance in NZ cricket. It started just before
    the Tangiwai rail disaster on the North Island main trunk railway (24/12)
    when a bridge was washed away by torrents of water from the Mt Ruapehu
    crater lake. The fiancee of RW Blair was killed.

*** B Sutcliffe (1) retired hurt on 0* from 9/2 to 81/6 (hospitalised after
    being struck on the head)
*** LSM Miller (1) retired hurt on 1* from 24/3 to 57/5 (also hospitalised
    after being struck on the chest)
*** Blair, not expected at the crease, batted at 11 and stayed while
    Sutcliffe hit Tayfield for 3 further 6s in 4 balls. Blair himself also
    hit Tayfield for 6.
