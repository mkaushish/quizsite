*** This was the Croft/Goodall test. At tea on day 3, WI were so incensed by
    umpire Goodall that they refused to come out for session 3 until he was
    replaced. They emerged after a delay of 11 minutes, but removed all gear
    from the dressing room at the end of the day's play. The following day
    was a rest day but officials were fully occupied ensuring that the game
    continued.

*** On the following day, Colin Croft "again behaved abominably, needling
    umpire Goodall, petulantly knocking off the bails and eventually charging
    deliberately into the umpire. What made matters worse was that Mr Goodall
    then had to walk the length of the pitch to discuss matters with Lloyd,
    whose lack of action condoned this dismal performance taking place under
    his captaincy."

*** BA Edgar (1) retired hurt on 5* from 14/0 to 15/1
