    Fleming at long-leg.
*** Malcolm 29 (18b 24m 3x4 2x6)

*** Rain delayed approx. 15 mins after lunch.
*** Play continued for 3.3 overs until again rain caused a cessation (play
    stopped at 2:19)
*** Play was officially abandoned at approximately 5:30 local time due to
    incessant drizzle.

*** Aus 1st innings
*** Healy was dismissed off the last ball before lunch.
*** Australia saved the follow-on with four byes off Malcolm.
*** Career-best figures for Gough, and his first innings haul of 5 wickets.

*** Atherton 50 (134b 180m 3x4)
*** Hick 98* (161b 255m 10x4 1x6)

*** Eng declared about 40 minutes before Tea, giving Aus exactly 30 minutes
    to bat before the interval.

*** Aus 2nd innings
*** Gough's first ball of the innings was short and hit Slater on the body.
    He thus missed out on the hat-trick.
*** Slater (when on 74, Aus 157) was dropped by Crawley at mid-wicket when he
    tried to loft a ball.
