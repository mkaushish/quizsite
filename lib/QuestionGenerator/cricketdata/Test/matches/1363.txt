*** Day 1
*** 2nd new ball taken on 4th ball of the 83rd over (bowled by Ganesh).
*** Chanderpaul's maiden Test century, 100 from 231 balls, 8x4.
*** Indian over rate was very slow and play was extended beyond the close by
    an hour, but bad light stopped the play with 4.2 overs remaining.

*** Day 2
*** After Lunch, Umpire Lloyd Barker was indisposed and off the field as
    something had fallen into his eyes. The reserve umpire (4th umpire)
    Dalton Holder stood in for him until the first drinks break after Lunch.
*** Slow over rate from West Indies (roughly 12.2 per hour) caused the play
    to be extended an hour beyond. Still the overs couldn't be completed, as
    the bad light stopped the play.

*** Day 3
*** Kuruvilla picks up maiden 5 wkt haul.
*** West Indies skittled out for their lowest score against India.
*** India had to bat for 6 overs. Bad light stopped the play. For the third
    straight day, play was extended by another hour after the close of play
    time.
