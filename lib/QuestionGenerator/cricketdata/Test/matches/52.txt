*** Rain prevented play until 4.55pm. on the first day, caused 24 wickets to
    fall on the second, and led to Australia being dismissed for their lowest
    total in England until 1902.
*** Peel ended his Test career with the splendid analysis of 6 for 23; the
    fourth of those wickets was his hundreth in Test matches.
*** Five players threatened strike action before the start because of a
    dispute over match fees. Although Abel, Hayward and Richardson relented,
    Gunn and Lohmann refused to play.
