*** Ranjitsinhji, although ill, emulated H Graham by scoring a hundred in his
    first Test in Australia having done so in England.
*** MacLaren, deputising for AE Stoddart whose mother had died, scored a
    hundred in his first Test as captain.
*** Darling had the distinction of being the first left-hander to score a
    hundred in a Test match.
*** McLeod was run out by Storer when he left his crease after being bowled
    by a no-ball. His deafness prevented him from hearing the umpire's call.
*** Kelly became the first wicket-keeper to prevent any byes in a total of
    over 500.
