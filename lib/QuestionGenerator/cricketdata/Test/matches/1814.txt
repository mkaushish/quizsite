*** Pakistan refused to come out after the tea interval, leading to the
    umpires awarding the match to England 20 minutes later. Despite Pakistan
    later being willing to play, the umpires insisted the result must stand.
    This was confirmed by the respective boards later that night at 10pm.

*** The match was originally awarded to England. This result was amended to
    an abandonment by the ICC in July 2008 although the change was disputed
    by the MCC, the custodians of the Laws of Cricket. In January 2009 the
    ICC voted to reverse their earlier decision and allow the original
    awarding of the Test to England to stand.
