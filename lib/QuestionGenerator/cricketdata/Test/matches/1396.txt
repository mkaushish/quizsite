*** Play was suspended after 10.1 overs (56 minutes) after the batsmen had
    been struck several times by balls which lifted dangerously off a length.
    Lengthy discussions ensured and after another 10 minutes the players left
    the field. An hour-and-a-half later the match was abandoned.
*** An additional Test was scheduled for 5-9 February at Port-of-Spain
*** David Richards, the ICC chief executive, said: "It is possible for ICC to
    rule that the match should be scrubbed out, but I think it is unlikely."
    Eventually it was ruled that the Test was valid and all performances
    counted towards career records
