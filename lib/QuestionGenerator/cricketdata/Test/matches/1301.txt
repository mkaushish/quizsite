*** Day 1
*** Tea was taken 20 minutes early because the sun's reflection of the roof
    of a greenhouse was disturbing the batsmen.
*** RC Russell got his 100th Test dismissal when he caught Bishop.
*** Crawley was dismissed in the final over of the day.

*** Day 2
*** Tea taken early due to rain.
*** Play abandoned 15 mins after scheduled close due to bad light with 5
    overs remaining.

*** Day 3
*** Cork unsettles the bail and runs 4 but the fielders do not notice this
    and do not appeal. He went on to score 56 not out.
*** Hooper stayed off from the field because of an injured finger and so
    could not bat above no. 7.

*** Day 4
*** Cork takes a hat-trick in the very first over of the day. This is the
    22nd hat-trick in test cricket.
*** Lara scores the first century of the series for either side.
*** RA Smith retired hurt at 47/3 (fractured cheek bone after being struck by
    a ball from Bishop)

*** Streakers (male and female) interrupt the match very often.
