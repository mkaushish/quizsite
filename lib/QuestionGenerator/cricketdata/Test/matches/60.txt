*** The first five-match rubber in England began with the first Test ever
    staged at Nottingham.
*** WG Grace, playing his last Test was 50 years and 320 days old when the
    match ended; only W Rhodes played Test cricket at a greater age, and by
    coincidence, he was making his debut in Grace's last match.
