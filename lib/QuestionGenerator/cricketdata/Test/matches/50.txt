*** Grace completed his 1,000 runs in Test cricket.
*** The forth-wicket partnership of 221 between Trott and Gregory was a new
    record for any wicket in Test matches.
*** Lohmann ended his final Test with career figures of 112 wickets, average
    10.75. in 18 matches. Besides recording the lowest average by any bowler
    taking 25 or more wickets, he remains the most frequent wicket-taker, at
    34 balls per dismissal.
*** Less that five years later Lohmann died of consumption at the age of 36.
