*** Day 1
*** Heavy overnight rain in Galle leaked under the cover onto the pitch area,
    and delayed the start of play for 3 hours.

*** Day 2
*** Play began at 1130GMT with 1 hour of play scheduled. 17 overs were bowled
    before bad light forced an early close. Due to water seeping under the
    covers after overnight rain the first two sessions were abandoned.

*** Day 3
*** A shower at the scheduled start time delayed play for one hour. The two
    remaining sessions will have 30 minutes added to them to make up the lost
    time.

*** HDPK Dharmasena's 6-73 in New Zealand's 1st innings is the 5th best
    bowling performance in an innings for Sri Lanka in Test cricket. It is
    the best by a Sri Lankan against New Zealand in Tests (previous: WPUJC
    Vaas 6-87 at Dunedin in 1994-95).
*** MRCN Bandaratilleke's match haul of 9-82 is the 3rd best Test match
    bowling figures by a Sri Lankan. It is the 2nd best match performance for
    Sri Lanka against New Zealand (best: WPUJC Vaas 10-90 at Napier in
    1994-95).
